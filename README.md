# Good-number
PrepBuddy gives you a positive integer number. You have to find the smallest good number greater than or equal to the given number. The positive integer is called good if it can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3 (i.e. no duplicates of powers of 3 are allowed). For example: 1.  84  is a good number:  84 = 3 4 + 3 1 , 2.  1  is a good number:  1 = 3 0 , 3.  13  is a good number:  13 = 3 2 + 3 1 + 3 0 , 4. but  2  is not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of  3  ( 2 = 3 0 + 3 0  is invalid), 5.  20  is not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of  3  (for example, the representations  20 = 3 2 + 3 2 + 3 0 + 3 0  is invalid), Note, that there exist other representations of  20  as sums of powers of  3  but none of them consists of distinct powers of  3 .
